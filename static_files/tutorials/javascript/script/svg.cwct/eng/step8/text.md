Our triangle is equilateral: it has three angles of equal size and three sides of equal length. Because the angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees, each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees.

A right triangle has one angle of 90 degrees. Can you modify the code to draw a right triangle instead?
