# Drawing with Scalable Vector Graphics

An equilateral triangle has three angles of equal size and three sides of equal length. Because the angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees, each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees. This code draws an equilateral triangle.

*Challenge:* A right triangle has one angle of 90 degrees. Modify the code to draw a right triangle instead.
