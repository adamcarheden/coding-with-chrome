To use the AIY you'll need two additional cables not included with the kit:

1. [A micro USB power supply that provides at least 2.1v](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995)

   Plug this cable into the AIY port labled *Power* and the other end into a converter, such as a "fast" phone charger, that plugs into an electrical outlet. Powering the AIY from your computer will not work because it won't provide sufficient amperage.

1. A micro USB cable that connects to your computer. (The end that connects to your computer is probably USB-A or USB-C.)

   Plug this cable into the AIY port labled *data* and into your computer.
