In the previous step we executed code, but how do
you know that code was really running on the AIY. This time,
we'll control the AIY itself.

Take a look at the example code. What do you think it will do?
Hit the *Play* button to run it and see if you're right.


#### Challenge
Can you make the LED button green?

Can you make it turn a different color each time it's pressed?

NOTE: After changing the code, you'll need to hit the *Stop*
and then the *Play* buttons to run your new code.
