If you haven't already, follow the instructions on setting up your AIY
[Voice](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/#assembly-guide) or
[Vision](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/vision/#assembly-guide) kit. Coding
with Chrome can automatically connect to your AIY through USB, so when you get
to the *Connect to your kit* step, continue with the next step of these
instructions instead.
