When you load an AIY file such as this one, Coding with Chrome will have a few
new features. Above the editor, the *Play* button will run your code, the *Stop*
button will stop execution of your code and the *X* button will
disconnect from the AIY.

If your AIY is plugged into your computer's USB port it should already be
connected. The word *Connected* above the toolbar indicates a successful
connection.

Below the editor is the AIY console. The text output of your program will appear
here.
